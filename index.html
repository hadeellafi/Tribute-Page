        <div id="tribute-info">Ibn Sina (980-1037), also known as Avicenna, was a Persian polymath who made significant
            contributions to the fields of medicine, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and poetry. Born in the city of
            Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan), Ibn Sina began his education at a young age, studying philosophy,
            logic, and mathematics under the tutelage of his father.
            <br><br>
            At the age of 16, Ibn Sina began studying medicine, and over the course of his career, he wrote several
            influential books on the subject, including the Canon of Medicine, which became one of the most widely used
            medical textbooks in Europe and the Islamic world for centuries.
            <br><br>
            In addition to his work in medicine, Ibn Sina made important contributions to the fields of mathematics and
            science. He developed a systematic method for solving cubic equations, and he made significant contributions
            to the fields of geometry, trigonometry, and number theory. He also made important contributions to the
            development of the scientific method, and he is credited with developing the idea of a controlled
            experiment.
            <br><br>
            Ibn Sina was also a prolific writer and philosopher, and he wrote influential works on a wide range of
            subjects, including metaphysics, ethics, logic, and politics. His work had a significant impact on Islamic
            philosophy and on the development of Western philosophy.
            <br><br>
            Overall, Ibn Sina was one of the most influential thinkers of the Islamic Golden Age, and his contributions
            to medicine, mathematics, science, and philosophy continue to be studied and celebrated today.
